# Faucets and Liquidity Pools

## Setup

### BNB & BUSD

Get yourself some BNB and BUSD [from BSC testnet faucet](https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smarthttps://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart).

### **Liquidity Pools**

Then, provide some liquidity for the wBAN-BNB and wBAN-BUSD pairs.

To make this more meaningful, check out the prices of BAN and BNB on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com) and try to get a 50/50 percent ratio, USD wise.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't wrap all your BNB as you need some available for your transaction fees!
{% endhint %}
