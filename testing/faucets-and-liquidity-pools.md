# Faucets and Liquidity Pools

## Setup

### BNB and WBNB

Get yourself some [BNB from BSC testnet faucet](https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smarthttps://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart).  
As the pair is going to be based on WBNB and **NOT** BNB, you need to [wrap some of your BNB as WBNB](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=bnb&outputCurrency=0xae13d989daC2f0dEbFf460aC112a837C89BAa7cd).  
**Don't wrap all your BNB as you need some left for transaction fees!**

### **Liquidity Pools**

Then, [provide some liquidity for the wBAN-WBNB pair](https://app.sushi.com/add/0x05dAc135787D2059A7a589fD3fFBCE3F676A3B8e/0xae13d989daC2f0dEbFf460aC112a837C89BAa7cd). To make this more meaningful, check out the prices of BAN and BNB on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com) and try to get a 50/50 percent ratio, USD wise.
