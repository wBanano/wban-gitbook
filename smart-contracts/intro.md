# Intro

## wBAN

wBAN are minted from BAN wrapped and burnt when unwrapped.

This smart-contract is an upgradeable BEP-20 token with minting being allowed only by a set of `signers` who can generate `receipts` and have them verified by the smart-contract in order to mint wBAN tokens.

## Benis

Benis is some kind of `MasterChef`which can create farms rewarding LP with wBAN.

It is a fork of [Sorbettiere](https://github.com/Popsicle-Finance/Contracts/blob/main/Sorbettiere.sol), rewarding per second instead of per block.
